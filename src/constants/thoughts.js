    text: "It was mid-March 2022, still quite chilly in Pittsburgh. We walked out of APTEKA, a European vegan restaurant, and stood in silence for maybe ten seconds. Vincent put on his dark-blue beanie and smiled awkwardly: \"wanna come to my apartment?\" \"I'd be down, but I already had plans to meet with my friends at some bar.\" I did. It was not an excuse. However, on the other hand, if I did desire to keep hanging out with him, I could've lied and canceled the other appointment, but I chose not to. We then said goodbye politely and parted ways. He turned left to catch bus 64, and I turned right to get on my Uber.\n\nI sat in the Uber through Lawrenceville, ruminating on the day. I started feeling nervous way too early. We planned to meet at 7 pm, but my stomach was in knots as soon as I woke up in the morning. I couldn't concentrate on schoolwork, so the day was spent doing makeup and picking out my outfit for the night. I got some free time anyway - I finally got an internship offer two weeks ago, and that was when I decided to download Hinge and try online dating for the first time. I wasn't looking for anything particular, and Vincent was the first guy to ask me out. Maybe because I was in such a good mood while traveling in Boston when receiving the message, I replied yes without hesitation.\n\nNow, after one and a half years, I can only recall two details of our first date - for the first ten minutes, my hands were shaking so badly because of my nervousness, and I couldn't manage to pour water for both of us from the bottle that was right in front of me - and I felt terrible for not doing that, and the fact that he said he loved The Batman played by Robert Pattinson. I have to admit that I did not like him. I did enjoy hanging out with him, but not in a romantic way, though we then went on second, third, and fourth dates before he got his master's degree and moved back to LA.\n\nMost of my memories with him are vague (but I can still remember clearly that I went to two bars in Shadyside with Hermes and Kush after that first date, and we chatted about what we would like to be known for after we die). But there is one thing that he has a significant impact on me till now. During our second date, after finishing dinner at Tocayo (a Mexican restaurant I chose because of my love for tacos), we went for a walk. He majored in psychology during undergrad, so we were chatting about that, and he mentioned that he recently was trying a type of meditation that involved expressing gratitude toward people he loves. At that time, I was skeptical about what that could bring; nonetheless, nowadays, I start my every day with a 5-minute meditation, and I always begin it with appreciating the universe, my family, and some close friends.\n\nLately, time seems to be slipping away like sand through my fingers. It's hard to believe that it's been almost two years since I flew from Taiwan to Pittsburgh on August 16, 2021. This experience has transformed me in ways that are difficult to articulate, and at times I wonder if I've changed at all. But then I would think of specific moments with specific people that have shaped me into who I am today, and I'm grateful for those encounters.\n\n...And I still think of Vincent occasionally when I listen to Lipstick On The Glass by Wolf Alice, a beautiful song he recommended. It may seem peculiar, but I prefer storing moments and individuals via music. Sadly, there have been very few memorable events, or in other words, very few meaningful songs added to my playlists lately.",

    text: "After reading a third of I May Be Wrong by Björn Natthiko Lindeblad, I walked back from Hub Coffee to my place, feeling more aware of and distant from the external surroundings and my internal torrent of thoughts. How absurd yet completely reasonable it is for a person like me, who spent her whole 23 years growing up in the center of humid, hot, and crowded Taipei, now wearing a Yankees hat, carrying the New Yorker tote bag, and wandering downtown Helena, MT.\n\nIt would be an understatement to say that there has been A LOT going on in my mind recently, to the extent that I cried during a 1:1 with my manager, who I've only known for around two months and have only met via Zoom. One of the root causes might be how stubborn I've been about endowing everything with meaning or how I constantly ought to find the root cause of everything.\n\nIn short, I am not happy and feel incredibly lonely. These days I've come to realize I used to own such a misperception of myself capable of being alone. Recently, without anyone near me that cares about and loves me, it has been challenging to justify the reasons for my existence. For the past couple of years, I've been the kind of person who enjoyed asking questions, getting to know people on an intellectual level, and developing deeper conversations and connections with those that exist in similar wavelengths. But recently, I noticed myself possessing a growing desire to be asked questions instead and to vent my feelings and disorganized thoughts recklessly. Meanwhile, I feel an enormous amount of guilt. Nobody, especially the ones that I've just known, again, for around two months because of my new job, is responsible for enduring my negativities and unconditionally helping me process this tangled nonsense.\n\nIt often requires much more courage to stay in one's hometown than to live in new places. One must be able to confront (or let go of) their past to live comfortably in their hometown. As for me, I've never had any American dream. I came to the States partly because I desperately wanted to escape Taiwan. The reason behind this would be a story for another day, but I sometimes refuse to admit I belong there. Nonetheless, I do not belong here either. Not Pittsburgh, where I stayed for one and a half years getting a master's degree, not New York City, where I spent a summer doing an internship, and certainly not Helena, where there is no one that I love or no one that loves me exists. It is, however, utterly terrifying to consider that I do not belong anywhere, which throws me into some bottomless abyss.\n\nAt this point, I don't even know what I am trying to convey. Regardless, it is alright. All these thoughts may be wrong. I may be wrong anyways. Björn stated in the book: \"We don't choose our thoughts. We don't control the shape they take. We can encourage some more than others and allow them more or less room. But we can't control what pops into our minds. We can only choose whether or not to believe it.\" He explicitly shared that what he values most from his seventeen years of full-time spiritual training is that he no longer believes his every thought.\n\nI hope one day I can become the same, genuinely accepting the uncontrollable stream of consciousness while being strong enough not to drown and keep my head above water. Or rather, let go of my ego and recognize that I may be wrong; if I relax and allow myself to sink into the ocean of thoughts, that is when I can finally breathe and realize there is in fact no water.",

    text: "Art museums are, the majority of the time, particularly intimidating and incredibly humbling. Before entering one, I must be aware and fully embrace the fact that I barely know anything, it is impossible to realize complete empathy inside (though it is also the case outside, or more precisely, in all directions and all manner of ways), and there exists no objective perfection. Nonetheless, the acknowledgment of the above facts does not stop me from trying. On the contrary, it has been the deep understanding of how powerless I am and how uncontrollable the experience is that allows me to walk in assuringly.\n\nBeing surrounded by art, I concentrate on dissolving my physical body and projecting my life experiences, emotions, beliefs, and soul into art pieces. This is the only action I can take. No matter how transparent my physical self becomes, I still exist, I am still standing, and humans can never turn into mirrors. Those artists’ life experiences, emotions, beliefs, and souls pervade the environment, yet I can only imagine and absorb them without the ability to perfectly reflect.\n\nRegardless, this whole process and the struggling attempts of communication are precisely the beauty of visiting art museums. It is the weight of expectations and those irrefutable failures that fuel me and keep me on going.",

    text: 'In retrospect, it was the most beautiful day of my life. Every single moment was immaculate. But back then, I was flooded with melancholy and failed to acknowledge that.\n\nIt was Aug 1st, one of the hottest days in Taiwan that year, almost 40°C or 104°F. I could sense the sunlight shooting toward me like arrows in every possible direction. There was no cloud above for me to hide. I realized that I could no longer eschew my feelings like I always did. I heard the leaves rustling beside me as I tasted the saltiness of my tears. The world was crumbling. I felt dizzy. All I could do was to spend all my efforts trying to keep my back straight and keep walking. "Stop ridiculing me!" I could hear the wind whispering that we all knew this was coming.\n\nFinally, I arrived at Rebirth. Kevin stood behind the bar table and looked at me silently as he was busy wiping the glasses and preparing to open the cafe. I had always been afraid of looking into his unfathomable eyes. He owned the ability to see through my deception and all my camouflage. "Brown sugar latte?" His lips barely moved. "No... can I get a cup of plain coffee this time..." I struggled to finish my sentence while sobbing intensely. He sighed, handed me a stack of tissues, and headed to the kitchen to look for some equipment. I believed he knew I was there to say goodbye since I had just lost the only reason that once allowed me to visit that place.\n\nEvery detail is still brutally vivid. I can remember how bitter the coffee was. Kevin said that he added spoons of alcohol. I can also recall him standing there at a short distance, sighing again and handing me a cup of hot chocolate after thirty minutes of me taking the tiniest sips of the coffee. I could never become the person I wish to be, so I have been adamant about refusing to drink coffee or alcohol from then on.\n\nThe most beautiful moment happened when I got home. My mental state was led to the middle of nowhere, and the darkness disgusted me. I tried to lie down while feeling extremely nauseous. Then the next moment, I found myself falling down the bed and struggling to climb to the bathroom. I vomited all the way there. When I sat on the bathroom floor and gasped in pain, I looked back. There were hundreds of flowers blooming in chocolate color. I could see them forming a mesmerizing trajectory, guiding me to even more profound despair.\n\nThat was when I encountered the aesthetic of destruction. I was indulged in my own existence.\n\nI have to admit my addiction toward sorrow and misery. Every moment is, in fact, invariably austere in objectivity. We project our thoughts and feelings to those moments and give them meanings ourselves. I envy Mizoguchi for possessing the ultimate beauty in his mind, the one that exceeds any possible entity in reality, the one that is perpetually out of reach, and the one that fails his expectation only when he allows it to. Its significance is forever ruled by his consciousness.\n\nHowever, the moment I reach the ultimate beauty, I will undoubtedly stop pursuing it. Therefore, the ultimate beauty only exists in things yet to be known. As Kashiwagi stated, it is the knowledge that changes the world, not action.\n\nAnd when I finally meet the ultimate beauty, to eternally own it, I must destroy it.',
