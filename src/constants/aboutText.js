  "Thank you for stopping by! I'm Eutina from Taipei and am currently living in Helena, MT. I know you are probably wondering about the purpose of this website. In fact, I have no idea either haha. I know I'm nowhere near a professional photographer, but if I have to give this place a meaning, I would say that it’s an embodiment of my endless gratitude towards this universe.\n\nThis universe, in all its unbelievably beautiful moments, has saved me from moments of despair many, many times. This is a place where I share with you all of those serendipities — encounters that reminded me that the sun would rise even when I felt like I’ve been running in circles in the middle of the night.\n\nOne of my biggest goals in life is to nurture a pair of eyes that can discover and admire beauty, not only those in physical forms but also the intangible ones like the human soul. Through these photos and short footages, you can witness my ongoing journey to beauty.\n\nSo I hope you can enjoy it, and again, thank you so much. Take care and I wish you all the best :)\n\nLove, Eutina\n\n\nI’m always down to meet new people! Feel free to reach out to me at eutinawei@gmail.com";
